# face-mask-detection
1. So after cloning the repository, we need to create the virtual environment . Use command "python -m venv <environment_name>"
2. Now activate the virtual environment using command ".\environment-name\Scripts\activate".
3. We need few libraries and packages , the required are written into the requirements file
4. To install all , use command "pip install -r requirements.txt".
5. The Folder named ipynb.checkpoints , run all the files separately after setting the models folder which contains the required files to train the model.
6. As the datasets are very large , i have given the link below to download the complete datasets .
7. https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1FCNMDhYMvJq-TozIj8n-H9iyq2hwissK?usp=sharing
8. All the required folder such as Data , Models should be keep properly and give path accordingly.
9. Now after training and predicting the model, To build the desktop app we need to install visual studio and set the virtual environment to connect our face mask deep      learning model .
10. Now install few extensions Python, Pythpn for vscode, Python extension pack, html snippets, html boilerplate.
11. AS we build our app using PyQt5. Let's brief about PyQt5----- "PyQt5 is the latest version of a GUI widgets toolkit developed by Riverbank Computing. It is a Python interface for Qt, one of the most powerful, and popular cross-platform GUI library. PyQt5 is a blend of Python programming language and the Qt library".
12. install PyQt5 using "pip install PyQt5".
13. Now everything is set, run the file "app.py" from the folder 3_app amd you will see the "face mask recognition software app".
